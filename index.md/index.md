### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first challenging lab I had. For the first time I realized what type of functions coding can have. In this example, we found the number of days between 2 different dates. I never thought of doing this, but after making an implementing a code that can do this, I began to wonder how much can coding really do.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was also a favorite because it was the first time I was using if statements. I really liked how I had to dissect and truly understand what the if statments would do when I was implementing them. Additionally, I was introudced to new operators that are used inside the if statement's, which was a challenging task to learn.
    
* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first time I used classes and objects. I was able to understand how these classes could be used as well as having multiple files to separate the content. At first this was a bit difficult to understand, but I liked that I was being challenged to think outside the box. Furthermore, I used a for loop as well as 2D vectors in order to extract different topics related to the lab. Through this lab I implemented various difficult topics and learned a lot.
