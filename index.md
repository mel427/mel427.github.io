### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first challenging lab I had. It was challenging because we used the Julian Day equation, and had to figure out how to implement this equation to get the proper results. For this portion of the lab I was learning how to pass paramaters in a function and how to call functions. In this code, we found the number of days between 2 different dates. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was also a favorite because it was the first time I was using if statements. In this lab, there was a secret number and the user had to guess what it was by choosing a number. The code would then share if it was too high, too low, correct, or wrong. I liked that I had to figure out what rules the if-statements needed in order for them to work. Additionally, I was introudced to new operators that are used inside the if statement's, which was a challenging task to learn. FInally, I used a nested if statement and I enjoyed the way I had to think in order to figure out the solution. 
    
* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first time I used classes and objects. In this lab, you would retrieve the highest and lowest price of a particular food item in relation to the amount of calories. I was able to understand how these classes could be used as well as having multiple files to separate the content. At first this was a bit difficult to understand, but I liked that I was being challenged to think outside the box. Furthermore, I used a for loop as well as 2D vectors in order to extract the different parts necessary to achieve the purpose. This lab required the implemenation of carious challenging topics learned throughout the year.
